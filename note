                                             if there is a same name its not gonna work correctly



      WebElement partOfPace=driver.findElement(By.className("here write class name"));
              System.out.println(partOfPace.getTagName());// here we can find some part of element tag name with getTagName
       partOfPace.sentKeys("omer");
       partOfPace.getAttribute("value"); // you can get name what u write in search box with this keyword

          it's a proses for develop app  successfully. it should be bug free and high quality and low cost.

          it hase 6 step for developing the app for successfully.this 6 step also divide 2 which is static testing and
           dynamic testing. ind static testing we have requirement gathering and design the app, in dynamic testing
           we have developer, tester,  first one is requirement gathering
          in requirement gathering client has a idea and he come to PO and BA and they analyze the project and they
          then they write a document and analyze, if there is a bug or not then they give that requirement to designer
          designer design the app and write the document which call blue print and then developer develop the app and
          tester test app tehn
